Project Name: Octrees

Student Name: Jose Antonio Frias Castillo


Controls:

Use the UI in order to swap between the different settings of the octrees and to check 
the amount of intersection checks that would be done through brute force or using the octrees. 
Move camera position with W/S A/D while holding right click.
Click on Random button to create 10 spheres at a time, left click in order to shoot 1 sphere.

Demo:

The demo includes a main square where the balls will be thrown at, then the octree will classify 
their level and ¨check collisions¨ among them if a possible collision is available (No actual 
collision resolution is done, it´s to rather see what collisions would be checked that frame, 
represented with a purple line between the two spheres)

Enjoy!
